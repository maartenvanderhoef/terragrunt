description: Enable shell functions in scaffold templates when scaffolding from catalog.
type: boolean
env:
  - TG_ENABLE_SHELL
---

Enables shell functions in boilerplate templates when scaffolding modules from the catalog. When enabled, templates can use shell commands like `{{shell "echo" "hello"}}` to execute system commands and include their output in generated files.

**Security Note**: Only enable shell functions when using trusted templates, as they can execute arbitrary commands on your system.

Precedence (highest to lowest):
1. CLI flag (`--enable-shell`)
2. Catalog configuration (`enable_shell = true`)
3. Default (disabled for security)

Example:

```bash
terragrunt catalog --enable-shell
```
