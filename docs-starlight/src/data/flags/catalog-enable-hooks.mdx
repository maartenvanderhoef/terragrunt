description: Enable hooks in scaffold templates when scaffolding from catalog.
type: boolean
env:
  - TG_ENABLE_HOOKS
---

Enables hooks in boilerplate templates when scaffolding modules from the catalog. When enabled, templates can define `before` and `after` hooks in their `boilerplate.yml` configuration that execute commands during the scaffolding process.

**Security Note**: Only enable hooks when using trusted templates, as they can execute arbitrary commands on your system.

Precedence (highest to lowest):
1. CLI flag (`--enable-hooks`)
2. Catalog configuration (`enable_hooks = true`)
3. Default (disabled for security)

Example:

```bash
terragrunt catalog --enable-hooks
```
